# PirateGame
Salvaged code for a game made in 2012 as a demo for teaching 14-year olds to code games using [Processing](https://processing.org/)
The code came from a packaged jar file so seems to have undergone some changes (e.g. constant vars replaced by literal values)

A simple game where the player must sail around destroying merchant ships with a cannon to earn money while avoiding losing 3 lives by being hit by rival pirate ships.
